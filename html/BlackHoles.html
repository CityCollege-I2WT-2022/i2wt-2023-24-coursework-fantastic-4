        <h2 class="h2text">What Is A Black Hole??</h2>
        <div>
        <p class="text">A <strong> black hole</strong> is a region of space-time where gravity is so strong that nothing, including light and other electromagnetic waves, 
            has enough energy to escape it. The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass can deform space-time to form a black hole.
            The boundary of no escape is called the event horizon. Although it has a great effect on the fate and circumstances of an object crossing it,
            it has no locally detectable features according to general relativity. In many ways, a black hole acts like an ideal black body, as it reflects no light. 
            Moreover, quantum field theory in curved space-time predicts that event horizons emit Hawking radiation, with the same spectrum as a black body of a temperature inversely 
            proportional to its mass. This temperature is of the order of billionths of a Kelvin for stellar black holes, making it essentially impossible to observe directly.

                Don't let the name<strong>  fool you</strong>: a black hole is anything but empty space. 
                Rather, it is a great amount of matter packed into a very small area - think of a star ten times more massive than the Sun squeezed into a sphere approximately 
                the diameter of New York City. The result is a gravitational field so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape.

            <p class="text">
            Most<strong>  black holes </strong>form from the remnants of a large star that dies in a supernova explosion.
            (Smaller stars become dense neutron stars, which are not massive enough to trap light.) 
            If the total mass of the star is large enough (about three times the mass of the Sun), 
            it can be proven theoretically that no force can keep the star from collapsing under the influence of gravity. However, as the star collapses, a strange thing occurs. 
            As the surface of the star nears an imaginary surface called the "event horizon," time on the star slows relative to the time kept by observers far away. 
            When the surface reaches the event horizon, time stands still, and the star can collapse no more - it is a frozen collapsing object.

            Even <strong> bigger</strong> black holes can result from stellar collisions. Soon after its launch in December 2004, NASA's Swift telescope observed the powerful, 
            fleeting flashes of light known as gamma ray bursts. Chandra and NASA's Hubble Space Telescope later collected data from the event's "afterglow," 
            and together the observations led astronomers to conclude that the powerful explosions can result when a black hole and a neutron star collide, 
            producing another black hole.
