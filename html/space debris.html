                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p id="intro">
                    One of the major issues we face regarding space exploration
                    and space travel in general is that our aircrafts and or
                    vehicles are polluting space throught space debris, or more
                    commonly known space junk.Any human made object that is in
                    orbir and has no serving purpose is considered as space
                    debris. Space debris can vary from old satellites to very
                    small particles of paint or aircraft parts. We estimate that
                    we have around 25000 visible space debris objects that can
                    be tracked . Those objects pose a real threat for the
                    working equipments that is currently operating in space and
                    also for future endeavors. To understand more about this
                    occuring past and future issue we have to see the history of
                    space exploration and the reasons that made space pollution
                    a problem.

                <h3>Space Race Era</h3>
                <p id="space-race-era">
                    Throught the 50s and the 60s space exploratoion became a
                    race between the us and ussr and the first attempts to reach
                    space had taken place and the first satelite was sent into
                    space , the historic Sputnik 1 that launched in 1957.
                    Sputnik 1 was the first human made space debri that reached
                    space , as Sputnik was made of 2 parts one being the
                    artificial satelite throught the rocket stage and the main
                    part the satellite itself. This made scientists sceptical
                    about the potential issues of space debris and the need to
                    keep track of them was more relevant than ever. Use of
                    radars that was used by the military helped with the track
                    of those debris as space exploration was begining to take
                    place and pieces of destroyed or malfunctiong satelites and
                    aircraft started to occupy earths orbit. Certain projects
                    have been created such as such as the
                    <a href="https://www.norad.mil/"
                        >North American Air Defense’s (NORAD)</a
                    >
                    known as the North American Aerospace Defense Command— Space
                    Object Catalog in order to improve upon the foundation that
                    Project Space Track set. In 1961 Thor-Ablestar rocket upper
                    stage exploded and created at least 200 cataloged fragments
                    and was the first major event that created manyt scape
                    debris.

                <p id="80s">
                    In the 70s and the 80s space exploration scyrocketed and
                    more so it was natural for more programs and initiatives to
                    appear to help with the space debris issues . For example,
                    NASA’s creation of what is now the
                    <a href="https://orbitaldebris.jsc.nasa.gov/"
                        >Orbital Debris Program (OPDO)</a
                    >
                    in 1979, also OPDO began conferring with the European Space
                    Agency about debris in 1987. the Air Force Space Debris
                    Research Program was established in the 1980s. The research
                    program began as multiple fragmentation events of Delta
                    rocket systems occurred and the U.S. forayed into ASAT
                    testing activities. In 1993 the
                    <a href="https://iadc-home.org/what_iadc"
                        >Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee
                        (IADC)</a
                    >
                    was founded in order to implement some guidelines and talk
                    about these issues.Furthermore In 1997 the the Center for
                    Orbital and Reentry Debris Studies (CORDS) was
                    established.CORDS was able to predict reentries since the
                    late 1990s and was able to document spacecraft and other
                    objects that have reentered the Earth’s atmosphere since
                    2000.

                <p id="future">
                    Nowadays we have an immense increase in commercial
                    operations that have taken the majority of space operations
                    , more than government and military activity. This shows in
                    the increace of space debris percentages as of 75% vs. 25%
                    in 2016 and now 62% vs. 38% . We have and 13% increase in
                    the space debris that occur throught the commercial
                    operations , like starlink , oneweb and other commercial
                    initiatives. The rising numbers of launches makes the
                    collision avoidance support is becoming a key component of
                    launch and orbit operations, despite that being a low
                    propabillity scenario. We have to adress space
                    sustainability, including developing capabilities to prevent
                    and remove orbital debris . Collaboration amongst the
                    goverments and the commercial companies has to take place in
                    order to adress the current and potential issues that may
                    occur. We already have suck initiatives as of
