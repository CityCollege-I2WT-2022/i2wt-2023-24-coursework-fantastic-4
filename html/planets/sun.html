        <h1>This is the Sun</h1>
        <p>The Sun is a G-type main-sequence star, primarily composed of hydrogen and helium. It generates energy through nuclear fusion in its core, producing light and heat. As a yellow dwarf star, it plays a crucial role in sustaining life on Earth and is the primary source of energy for our solar system.</p>
