<h1>This is Uranus</h1>
<p>Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun, and it is classified as an ice giant. It has a bluish-green hue due to the presence of methane in its atmosphere. Uranus is unique in the solar system because it rotates on its side, with its axis nearly parallel to its orbital plane.</p>
