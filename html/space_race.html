    <div class="title"><h1>The space race</h1></div>
    <div class="content">
    <p>The space race was a 20th century competition between the United States and Soviet Union for achievements in spaceflight capability.</p>
    <h1>Origins of the Space Race</h1>
    <p>The origins of the space race can be traced back to 1955, when both the United States and Soviet Union publicly announced their intentions to launch artificial satellites into orbit around the Earth. This kicked off a competition between the two Cold War rivals to demonstrate technological superiority in space. Both nations invested heavily into rocketry and aerospace research to build increasingly advanced launch vehicles and spacecraft.</p>
    <h1>Soviet Early Lead</h1>
    <p>The Soviet Union took an early lead in the space race when they successfully launched Sputnik 1 on October 4, 1957, the first ever artificial satellite to orbit the Earth. The beachball-sized spacecraft was a shock to many in the West and marked the start of the space age. The Soviets consolidated their lead when they launched Sputnik 2 in November 1957, carrying the first animal into orbit - a dog named Laika. This was followed by a string of successes, including the first images of the dark side of the Moon and the first humans into space and orbit - cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin in April 1961.</p>
    <h1>America Catches Up</h1>
    <p>Seeing the Soviet successes galvanized the United States into action. In 1958, President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed the National Aeronautics and Space Act, creating NASA to coordinate space exploration efforts. Early American launch attempts ended in high-profile disasters until the successful launch of Explorer 1 in January 1958, the first US satellite. With the creation of NASA's manned spaceflight Project Mercury in 1959, the Americans began catching up. Project Mercury's first major milestone was astronaut Alan Shepard becoming the first American in space in a suborbital flight in 1961.</p>
    <h1>The Moon Landing</h1>
    <p>By the early 1960s, President John F. Kennedy set a national goal of landing a man on the Moon by the end of the decade. To achieve this, NASA launched the Apollo Program, culminating in the first lunar landing mission, Apollo 11. On July 20, 1969, Apollo 11 succeeded when astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landed and walked on the lunar surface while Michael Collins orbited above. The Americans had won this leg of the space race.</p>
    <h1>Legacy</h1>
    <p>The space race drove rapid advances in rocketry, electronics, and spaceflight technology. It captured the imaginations of people around the world as humanity expanded into space capabilities never achieved before. The rivalry between the superpowers was both intensified and publicized by the race to the Moon's surface. Although the competition eased after the Moon landing, both nations continued advancing space exploration throughout the Cold War era and beyond.</p>
