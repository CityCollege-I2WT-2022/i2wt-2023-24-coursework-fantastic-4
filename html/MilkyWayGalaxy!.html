        <p class="text"><strong>Milky Way Galaxy</strong>, large spiral system consisting of several hundred billion stars,
            one of which is the Sun. It takes its name from the Milky Way, the term Milky Way is a translation of the Latin via lactea, from the Greek γαλαξίας κύκλος (galaxías kýklos), meaning "milky circle",
            the irregular luminous band of stars and gas clouds that stretches across the sky as seen from Earth. Although Earth lies well within the Milky Way Galaxy (sometimes simply called the Galaxy), 
            astronomers do not have as complete an understanding of its nature as they do of some external star systems.
            A thick layer of interstellar dust obscures much of the Galaxy from scrutiny by optical telescopes, and astronomers 
            can determine its large-scale structure only with the aid of radio and infrared telescopes, which can detect the forms of radiation that penetrate the obscuring matter.

            <p class="text">
            <strong>The Milky Way</strong> is one of the two largest galaxies in the <a href="IntergalacticNeighbourhood.html">Local Group</a> (the other being the Andromeda Galaxy),
                although the size for its galactic disc and how much it defines the isophotal diameter is not well understood.
                It is estimated that the significant bulk of stars in the galaxy lies within the 26 kilo parsecs (80,000 light-years) diameter,
                and that the number of stars beyond the outermost disc dramatically reduces to a very low number,
                with respect to an extrapolation of the exponential disk with the scale length of the inner disc.
