            <strong> Milky Way </strong> and the Andromeda Galaxy are a binary system of giant
            spiral galaxies belonging to a group of 50 closely bound galaxies known as the Local Group,
            surrounded by a Local Void, itself being part of the Local Sheet  and in turn the <strong>Virgo Super Cluster</strong>.
            Two smaller galaxies and a number of dwarf galaxies in the Local Group orbit the Milky Way. 
            The largest of these is the Large Magellanic Cloud with a diameter of 32,200 light-years. 
            It has a close companion, the Small Magellanic Cloud. The Magellanic Stream is a stream of neutral hydrogen gas extending from these two small galaxies 
            across 100° of the sky. The stream is thought to have been dragged from the Magellanic Clouds in tidal interactions with the Milky Way.
            Some of the dwarf galaxies orbiting the Milky Way are Canis Major Dwarf (the closest), Sagittarius Dwarf Elliptical Galaxy, Ursa Minor Dwarf, 
            Sculptor Dwarf, Sextans Dwarf, Fornax Dwarf, and Leo I Dwarf. 
            The smallest dwarf galaxies of the Milky Way are only 500 light-years in diameter. 
            These include Carina Dwarf, Draco Dwarf, and Leo II Dwarf. There may still be undetected dwarf galaxies that are dynamically bound to the Milky Way,
            which is supported by the detection of nine new satellites of the Milky Way in a relatively small patch of the night sky in 2015. 
            There are some dwarf galaxies that have already been absorbed by the Milky Way, such as the progenitor of Omega Centauri.

                    <strong> The Virgo Supercluster</strong> (Virgo SC) or the Local Supercluster (LSC or LS) is a mass concentration of galaxies containing the Virgo Cluster and Local Group,
                which itself contains the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies, as well as others.
                At least 100 galaxy groups and clusters are located within its diameter of 33 megaparsecs (110 million light-years). 
                The Virgo SC is one of about 10 million superclusters in the observable universe and is in the Pisces-Cetus Supercluster Complex, a galaxy filament.

                Surrounding the <strong> Virgo Super Cluster</strong> are a number of voids, devoid of many galaxies, the Microscopium Void to the "north", the Sculptor Void to the "left",
                the Boötes Void to the "right" and the Canes-Major Void to the "south". These voids change shape over time, creating filamentous structures of galaxies.
                The Virgo Super cluster, for instance, is being drawn towards the Great Attractor, which in turn forms part of a greater structure, called Laniakea!
