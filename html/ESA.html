		<h1>European Space Agency (ESA)</h1>
                <h3>Brief Overview</h3>
                <p id="Intro">Established in 1975 with 22 member states, the European Space Agency (ESA) is a multinational organization dedicated to advancing space exploration. Headquartered in Paris, France, ESA's primary objective is to promote Europe's space capability and ensure the positive impact of space endeavors on society. The agency engages in a diverse range of space-related activities, space exploration missions, satellite communications, Earth observation initiatives, and scientific research endeavors. With an annual budget of €7.08 billion and approximately 2,200 staff members, ESA plays a pivotal role in shaping Europe's global competitiveness in the space industry. ESA is a leading member in international space cooperation. The agency works with space agencies around the world, including NASA, Roscosmos, and JAXA, on a range of joint projects.

                <h3>Foundation</h3>
                <p id="foundat"> After the second world war, many european scientists decided to immigrate to the eunited states to continue their scientific pursuits. In the 1950s when Europe was steadily gaining back its economic and cultural status, the need for investment in space related subjects was obvious to scientists.European countries were left behind in the space race and felt the need to try to make a unified act to approach space exploration. Two months after the launch of the sputnik-1 european scientists decided to hold a discusion on the foundation of a common Western European space agency. The meeting was attended by scientific representatives from eight countries. n an effort to advance their space exploration capabilities, Western European nations established two distinct organizations: ELDO (European Launcher Development Organisation) focused on developing a launch system, and ESRO (European Space Research Organisation), which served as the precursor to the European Space Agency.ESRO was established on 20 March 1964 and from 1968 to 1972, ESRO launched seven research satellites. Both agencies faced challenges due to insufficient funding and diverse objectives among their members. In 1975 the merging o ELDO and ESRO created ESA as it stands today. Its founding members were  Belgium, Denmark, France, West Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. ESA launched its first major scientific mission in 1975, Cos-B, a space probe monitoring gamma-ray emissions in the universe, which was first worked on by ESRO.

                <h3>Through The Years</h3>
            <p id="Years">
            ESA had a plethora of activities and participated with success in many scientific endeavors both on the research field and with  space missions. In a collaboration with NASA in 1978 the first high orbit satellite < a href =”https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Ultraviolet_Explorer” > International Ultraviolet Explorer</a> was launched successfully and operated for 18 years.  In 1986, the European Space Agency (ESA) launched its first deep-space mission, Giotto, to study the comets Halley and Grigg–Skjellerup. In 1989, another ESA mission, Hipparcos, was launched, this time with the aim of mapping stars. During the 1990s, ESA collaborated with NASA on several missions, including SOHO, Ulysses, and the Hubble Space Telescope. The European Space Agency (ESA) has developed and launched several rockets to transport scientific and commercial payloads into space. The first, Ariane 1, was launched in 1979 and primarily carried commercial payloads from 1984 onwards. The next two versions of the Ariane rocket, Ariane 2 and 3, served as intermediate steps in the development of a more advanced launch system, Ariane 4, which operated from 1988 to 2003 and cemented ESA's position as a global leader in space launch technology. With further development Ariadne 5 was introduced with a total of 112 successful launches and ESA has under development its successor launch vehicle, the Ariadne 6. ESA has been part of many joint missions and research projects but has also proven its value in the space field with many missions on its own.  The European Space Agency (ESA) has undertaken several notable programs, including SMART-1, a probe that tested innovative space propulsion technology, the Mars Express and Venus Express missions, and the development of the Ariane 5 rocket, which played a important role in the International Space Station (ISS) partnership. Additionally, ESA continues to pursue many scientific endeavors, primarily in the field of astronomy like  Corot mission, launched in 2006, which marked a significant step forward in the search for exoplanets. On 21 January 2019, ArianeGroup and Arianespace announced a one-year contract with ESA to study and prepare for a mission to mine the Moon for lunar regolith. After a decade of meticulous planning and construction, the Euclid spacecraft was successfully launched on July 1, 2023, marking a significant milestone in the quest to unravel the mysteries of dark energy and dark matter. This collaborative venture between the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Euclid Consortium aims to precisely measure the accelerating expansion of the universe, providing valuable insights into these enigmatic cosmic entities.
