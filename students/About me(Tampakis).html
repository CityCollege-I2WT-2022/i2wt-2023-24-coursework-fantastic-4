            Hello Everyone! My name is Nikos, and I am 23 years old(officially a boomer I guess -_-). 
            I was born in 21st of April 2023 in Thessaloniki where I have stayed
            most of my life. I am studying in BSc Hons Computer Science in CITY College, University of York Europe Campus 
            and I am currently working really hard to achieve my goals. My hoobies are Gaming, body training and cooking. 
            I am currently interested in the gaming development side of things regarding my interests in Computer Science 
            and maybe Data Science sometime in the future.

            First of all I started searching information about the specific topics of my website. Once I found and collected everything regarding my website,
            I immediatelly started making plans on how I want my website to look. Once I found my preferred layout and style, I started working on the look 
            of the website, that means my css code. Once this was finished I started assembling the information about my website and giving it form using HTML 
            code.
